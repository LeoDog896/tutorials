<p align="center">Welcome to the tutorials repository for SurrealDB, with official and community contributed tutorials.</p>

#### Official tutorials

To view the official tutorials and code walkthroughs, view the [`official`](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials/tree/main/official) folder in this repository.

#### Community tutorials

To view the community-submitted tutorials and code walkthroughs, view the [`community`](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials/tree/main/community) folder in this repository.

#### Contributing

If you would like to make a contribution, please follow the instructions in the Contribution Guidelines and then open a Pull-Request. One of the community managers will then evaluate your tutorial, and provide you with feedback.

Due to the way we set up the repo you only need to create **ONE** file, which is your guide itself (outside of images/assets). Please include the configuration bit in the top of the template file and don't change it's structure, else the github action will fail.
