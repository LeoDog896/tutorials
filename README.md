<p align="center">Welcome to the tutorials repository for SurrealDB, with official and community contributed tutorials.</p>

#### Official tutorials

To view the official tutorials and code walkthroughs, view this repository's [`official`](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials/tree/main/official) folder.

#### Community tutorials

To view the community-submitted tutorials and code walkthroughs, view this repository's [`community`](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials/tree/main/community) folder.

#### Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please follow the instructions in the Contribution Guidelines and then open a Pull Request in the [surrealdb/tutorials repository](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials). One of the community managers will then evaluate your tutorial and provide you with feedback.

Due to how we set up the repo, you only need to create **ONE** file, which is your guide (outside of images/assets). Please include the configuration bit at the top of the template file and don't change its structure; otherwise, the GitHub action will fail.

A complete list of requirements can be found in the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/surrealdb/tutorials/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).
