Please follow the contribution guidelines when creating a new guide:
- A Pull Request will be rejected if it's subject is wider than about only one guide.
- Please follow the template file and keep the top configuration in the same order. Otherwise the test will fail and it will **not** build.
- If you think something can be done better about the repository, please open an issue first to discuss the matter! It will create a mess if everybody opens a PR for small improvements to be rejected.
- **Note**: Because of the way we built the repo, your PR only needs to contain **one** file, which is the guide itself (outside of potential images). All other changes **will be rejected**.
- More can be found in the [Pull Request Template](../.github/pull_request_template.md)
